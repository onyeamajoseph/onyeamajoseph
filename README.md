My GitHub portfolio reflects a growing passion for data analysis, problem-solving, and practical insights. I’ve worked on projects spanning retail analytics, environmental trends, and customer behavior—using tools like SQL and Excel to turn raw data into meaningful narratives. Whether analyzing sales data, historical events, or customer patterns, my goal is always to deliver clear, actionable insights. Each project is a step forward in my journey to merge analytical thinking with real-world impact across various industries.
